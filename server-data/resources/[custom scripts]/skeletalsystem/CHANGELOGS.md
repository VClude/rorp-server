Added config option to register healSkelly command via es group command or general console command.
skeletalsystem.UseESCommand
Set true if using ESX v1.2 or above.
Set false if using ESX v1.1 or below (with essentialmode reliance).
Also changed some stuff in NativeUI dependency included, fixing some annoying console-spamming errors that appeared for literally no reason.

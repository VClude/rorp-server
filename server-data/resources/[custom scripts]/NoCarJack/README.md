# NoCarJack

### Version

No more random grand theft auto.

* Works on all vehicles (cars,bikes,trucks,helicopters,planes,boats,...)
* Prevent parked vehicle stealing
* Prevent any kind of grand theft auto (car-jacking, passenger car-jack, etc)
* Vehicle stealing/car-jacking is only allowed only by a predefined threshold
* Compatible with any vehicle control script
* Ability to skip a vehicle check with an event
* Low CPU usage

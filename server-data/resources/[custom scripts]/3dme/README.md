## Updates
#### V1.1
* The text display an exact amount of time (thanks to @SaltyGrandpa) ;
* Added "the person" at the beginning of the text (```Line 16``` if you want to change the language) ;
* Using /me multiple times doesn't make it unreadable.
#### V1.2
* Bugs fixes ;
* Changed the native color and removed the shadow and the outline (you can still reactivate it) ;
* Now draw when you are close to the person (50 m).
#### V1.3
* Now send a chat message to the people close to the person ;
* Can now draw a background to the text ;
* Added the options to draw a dropshadow.
#### V2.0
* The command is now server sided ;
* No longer creates logs, you will have to use a **real** log resource ;
* No longer prints the action in the chat ;
* Removed some design options (background and dropshadow) as it's no coherent with the idea I had on the resource ;
* The code has been globally updated, more comments, more optimisation ;
* Some bugs have been fixed.
#### V2.1
* Added Onesync Infinity support thanks to *@glitchdetector* ;
* Replaced `__resource.lua` by its new version `fxmanifest.lua`.

## Note
* This may not work if are you using a custom chat resource.
* This could conflict with other /me scripts (disable them).
